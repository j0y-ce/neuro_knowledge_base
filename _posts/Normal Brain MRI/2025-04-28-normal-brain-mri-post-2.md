Grey and white matter are represented in different intensities depending on the MRI sequence. For more explanations of the differences between MRI sequences, please consult the chapters for MRI Sequences.

<b>T1</b>
Grey matter intensity less than white matter.
Ie. Grey matter is slightly darker than white matter.

Ie. Grey matter is slightly brighter than white matter.

<b>FLAIR</b>
Grey matter intensity > white matter.
Ie. Grey matter is slightly brighter than white matter. 
However, in opposition to T2, CSF is attenuated (ie. dark) on FLAIR.
