<b> Thalamus </b>

The thalami are bilateral deep brain structures mostly composed of grey matter. 
They lie on just superior to the midbrain and form the floor of the lateral ventricles.
On coronal section, the thalamus is found on each side of the third ventricle and immediately under each lateral ventricle.

On axial section, the thalamus is found around the level where the lateral ventricle splits up into its anterior and its posterior horns. 
Each thalamus is nestled on each side of the third ventricle.

<b> Hypothalamus </b>
The hypothalamus is a deep brain structure that acts as a control center for the body’s endocrine, autonomic and somatic systems. 
Some examples of its function includes regulating the concentration of a number of hormones, which then go onto regulate functions like feeding, body temperature, reproduction, growth and development, water balance and more.
Like its name suggests (“hypo-” meaning “under”/ “inferior”), the hypothalamus is located just below the thalamus. 
It is separated by the superior hypothalamic sulcus, and together both structures form the lateral walls of the third ventricle.

The hypothalamus can be found just above the sella, where the pituitary sits.
