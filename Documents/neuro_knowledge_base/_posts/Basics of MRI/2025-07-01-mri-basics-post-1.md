Often referred to as the ‘anatomical sequence’, T1-weighted MRIs are thought to most closely resemble macroscopic (dissection) views of normal anatomy.
In T1, signal intensity goes from:

- Fat: high signal intensity
- Muscle: intermediate signal intensity
- Fluid: low signal intensity

For CNS structures, white matter has a higher signal intensity than grey matter. In other words, grey matter literally looks darker on T1 MR than white matter.
T1-weighted MRIs also serve as the basis for contrast-enhanced MRI.


Most contrast agents used in MRI are gadolinium-based and can be used to appreciate vascular structures (most often the vessel wall), tumor location, areas of inflammation/infection, and more. The contrast is injected intravenously and make vessels (consequently, areas of higher perfusion) appear more hyperintense.


A modified T1 sequence can be performed to decrease the signal intensity of ordinarily hyperintense fat. This is called ‘fat suppression’ and is frequently performed in conjunction to gadolinium enhancement in order to make the contrast-enhanced structures easier to appreciate. Fat suppression is commonly used in structures whose visualization can be masked by adjacent fat tissue, as is the case in the spinal cord.
